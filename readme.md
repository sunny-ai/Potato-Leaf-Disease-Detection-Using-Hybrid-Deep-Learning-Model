# Potato Leaf Disease Detection Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model

This project focuses on detecting diseases in potato leaves using a hybrid deep learning model. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural experts in identifying diseases early to improve crop yield and quality.

## Features

- **Hybrid Deep Learning Model**: Combines multiple deep learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
- **Image Classification**: Classifies potato leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading and analyzing images.
- **Scalable Solution**: Can be extended to detect diseases in other crops.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images of potato leaves, including both healthy and diseased samples. The dataset is preprocessed to enhance model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sunny-ai/Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Model.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Potato-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Using-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Model
    ```
